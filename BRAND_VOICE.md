# TacticDev Brand Voice & Messaging Guidelines

## Overview

TacticDev's brand voice reflects who we are: a high-velocity product team that helps ambitious founders ship without sacrificing quality. Our communication should always be professional, actionable, and founder-centric.

## Core Voice Attributes

### 1. **Professional Yet Approachable**

We're experts, but we don't talk down to anyone.

✅ **Do**: "We design, build, and launch digital products for venture-backed startups."
❌ **Don't**: "We're the world's best product team and you need us."

✅ **Do**: "Let's diagnose what's blocking your roadmap."
❌ **Don't**: "You're probably doing everything wrong."

### 2. **Action-Oriented**

Focus on outcomes, momentum, and tangible results—not buzzwords.

✅ **Do**: "Ship in weekly loops", "Launch in 6 weeks", "3.2× faster shipping"
❌ **Don't**: "Synergistic ideation", "Thought leadership", "Best practices"

✅ **Do**: "We'll reply within one business day with a tactical plan."
❌ **Don't**: "We'll circle back when bandwidth permits."

### 3. **Founder-Centric**

Always prioritize the founder's perspective, challenges, and goals.

✅ **Do**: "Tell us what you need to ship next."
❌ **Don't**: "Here's what we think you should do."

✅ **Do**: "We keep founders close to the work while removing day-to-day friction."
❌ **Don't**: "We'll handle everything—just step aside."

### 4. **Technically Credible**

Show expertise through specifics, not jargon.

✅ **Do**: "TypeScript, React, and modern cloud", "Secure infra on Vercel, Fly, or Cloudflare"
❌ **Don't**: "Cutting-edge tech stack", "Next-gen architecture"

✅ **Do**: "99.9% uptime across managed products"
❌ **Don't**: "Rock-solid reliability"

### 5. **Confident but Humble**

We deliver results, not promises. Let outcomes speak for themselves.

✅ **Do**: "Scaled a lending platform to 4 countries in 10 weeks."
❌ **Don't**: "We're the only team that can scale your platform."

✅ **Do**: "If it's not a fit, we'll still share useful next steps."
❌ **Don't**: "We can solve any problem."

## Tone by Context

### Website Copy
- **Tone**: Confident, energetic, outcome-focused
- **Style**: Short sentences, active voice, specific metrics
- **Example**: "Launch in 6 weeks" vs. "We can help you launch quickly"

### Documentation
- **Tone**: Clear, instructive, efficient
- **Style**: Imperative statements, code examples, logical structure
- **Example**: "Run `npm start` to begin development" vs. "You might want to try running npm start"

## Key Messaging Pillars

### 1. **Speed Without Sacrifice**
We move fast but maintain quality. Velocity is our competitive advantage.

**Example**: "Product teams that ship clean, modern software at founder speed."

### 2. **Integrated Product Squads**
Strategy, design, and engineering move together—no handoffs or silos.

**Example**: "We combine product leaders, senior designers, and battle-tested engineers."

### 3. **Founder Partnership**
We work *with* founders, not *for* them. Collaborative, transparent, ego-free.

**Example**: "We keep founders close to the work while removing day-to-day friction."

### 4. **Proven Track Record**
Real metrics from real projects. Testimonials from actual founders.

**Example**: "Rebuilt scheduling experience, lifting weekly active providers by 68%."
