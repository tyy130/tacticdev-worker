# tacticdev-worker (monorepo)

This repository contains the backend and chat application code for the tacticdev project.

## Note on the static site

The static marketing site has been split into its own repository: [tacticdev-site](https://github.com/tyy130/tacticdev-site).

The site was moved as a clean split (no preserved history) and is now maintained under that repository.

If you manage deployments or CI for the site, please use the `tacticdev-site` repository. This monorepo focuses on the worker/chat services.
