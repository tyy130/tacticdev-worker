# About TacticDev

## Who We Are

TacticDev is a high-velocity product development agency that helps ambitious founders ship category-defining products without compromise. We're a distributed team of senior product leaders, designers, and engineers who have built for YC startups, a16z-backed companies, and bootstrapped founders.

## Our Mission

**Empower founders to build exceptional products at the speed of their ambition.**

We believe the best products come from founders who stay close to the work. Our role is to remove friction, accelerate execution, and bring world-class craft to every sprint—without the overhead of a full-time team.

## What We Do

We design, build, and launch digital products for venture-backed startups that need to move fast without sacrificing quality. Our integrated product squads combine:

- **Product Strategy**: Discovery, roadmapping, and north-star planning
- **Design Excellence**: Research-driven UX, visual design, and scalable design systems
- **Engineering Craft**: Full-stack development, DevOps, and automated QA

## Our Values

### 🚀 **Velocity Without Compromise**
We ship fast, but we don't cut corners. Clean code, thoughtful design, and rigorous testing are non-negotiable.

### 🤝 **Founder Partnership**
Your vision drives everything. We work *with* you, not *for* you. Transparent communication, zero ego, collaborative outcomes.

### 📊 **Outcome-Focused**
We measure success by real metrics: launches shipped, revenue generated, users delighted. Not hours logged or features built.

### 🛠️ **Technical Excellence**
We use modern, maintainable tech stacks. We document our work. We build for scale. We leave codebases better than we found them.

### 🌍 **Remote-First, Human-First**
We're distributed across time zones but aligned on outcomes. Async communication, clear documentation, and regular sync points keep us moving together.

## Our Team

### Product Leaders
Our product strategists have shipped 0→1 products, scaled platforms to millions of users, and advised founders through Series A+. They bring frameworks, not frameworks—practical methods tested in the real world.

### Senior Designers
Our designers blend user research, visual craft, and interaction design. They've built design systems used by teams of 50+, prototyped AI-powered experiences, and shipped award-winning products.

### Battle-Tested Engineers
Our engineers have architected platforms handling millions of requests, built real-time collaboration tools, scaled databases, and debugged production incidents at 3 AM. They know TypeScript, React, Node.js, Postgres, Redis, and modern cloud platforms.

## Our Approach

### 1. **Integrated Squads**
Strategy, design, and engineering move together—no silos, no handoffs. We work in parallel loops so every week ships value.

### 2. **Founder-Close**
Weekly demos, transparent roadmaps, Slack access to the full team. You're never out of the loop.

### 3. **Outcome-Driven Sprints**
We tie every sprint to measurable outcomes: launches, user growth, retention lifts, or investor milestones.

### 4. **Built to Last**
We document our decisions, train your team, and build systems that scale beyond our engagement.
